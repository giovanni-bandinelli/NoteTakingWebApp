## Note-Taking Web App

This is my attempt to convert [Frontend Mentor's challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/note-taking-web-app-773r7bUfOG) into a fully functional full-stack application.

I'm building it with as few libraries as possible using the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). So far, I've completed:

- [x] Auth features: Register, Login, Google OAuth, Email reset links  
- [x] User settings: Theme and font customization  
- [x] Desktop layout

I'm planning to host the client on **Vercel** and the server (plus PostgreSQL DB) on **Railway**.



### ðŸš§ Features Still in Progress

- [ ] Responsive layout for mobile/tablet 
-  [ ] Toasts, modals, and a proper error display system (e.g. "user already registered")
-  [ ] Notes CRUD (ironically saving this for last since Iâ€™ve got a clear scope and itâ€™s the easiest :P )
- [ ] Full keyboard accessibility
- [ ] Markdown + image support (maybe â€” still deciding)
