      <p>since this is a MVP project I decided to leave out the mobile & tablet layout, I know it would have added a lot to the level of "polishness" of the project but it's just react-queries/media-queries but lots of work. Right now I'd much prefer focusing on learning opportunities. If you want to properly try this website use a 1000 px width resolution :) </p>
